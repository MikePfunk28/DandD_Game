    "\n",
    "1. **Movement System:**\n",
    "   - **Dice Roll or Card Draw:** Players can choose to roll a die or draw a card to determine their movement.\n",
    "   - **Region and Availability Zone (AZ) Selection:** Players land on different regions and AZs based on their movement.\n",
    "   - **Home Region:** Each player has a designated home region with specific advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Serverless Spells:**\n",
    "   - **Quick-Use Abilities:** Represent serverless services (e.g., AWS Lambda, CloudFront) as spells that provide quick advantages.\n",
    "   - **Spell Mechanics:** Spells can be cast during encounters to influence outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Turn-Based Setup and Threat Encounters:**\n",
    "   - **Setup Phase:** At the beginning of each turn, players choose security measures.\n",
    "   - **Threat Encounter:** Players face threats based on the region they've landed in.\n",
    "   - **Charges and Constraints:** Operating in non-home regions incurs charges, affecting resource management.\n",

    "# Panda3D Quiz App - Fixing Text Alignment and Missing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "# This notebook demonstrates how to fix text alignment issues and handle missing\n",
    "# sound and particle effect files in a Panda3D quiz application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Text Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "# The primary issue is that the question text and answer buttons are not aligned\n",
    "# to the left side of the screen. This can be fixed by adjusting the `pos` and\n",
    "# `align` properties of the `OnscreenText` and `DirectButton` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 1. Modify `question_text` creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In your `__init__` method, find the code that creates the question text and\n",
    "# update it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# self.question_text = OnscreenText(\n",
    "#     text=\"\",\n",
    "#     pos=(-0.7, 0.7),  # Move text to the left side\n",
    "#     scale=0.07,\n",
    "#     fg=(1, 1, 1, 1),\n",
    "#     align=TextNode.ALeft,  # Align text to the left\n",
    "#     wordwrap=30  # Adjust this value to control text wrapping\n",
    "# )\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# This sets the text position to the left side of the screen and aligns the text\n",
    "# to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 2. Update button creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the `create_buttons` method to align the buttons with the new text\n",
    "# position:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# def create_buttons(self):\n",
    "#     for button in self.option_buttons:\n",
    "#         button.destroy()\n",
    "#     self.option_buttons = []\n",
    "\n",
    "#     y_pos = 0.3\n",
    "#     for i in range(4):\n",
    "#         button = DirectButton(\n",
    "#             text=\"\",\n",
    "#             text_scale=0.05,\n",
    "#             text_fg=(1, 1, 1, 1),\n",
    "#             text_align=TextNode.ALeft,\n",
    "#             frameColor=(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1),\n",
    "#             frameSize=(-1.5, 1.5, -0.3, 0.3),  # Adjust frame size as needed\n",
    "#             pos=(-0.7, 0, y_pos),  # Move buttons to the left to align with question\n",
    "#             scale=0.1,\n",
    "#             command=self.check_answer,\n",
    "#             extraArgs=[i]\n",
    "#         )\n",
    "#         self.option_buttons.append(button)\n",
    "#         y_pos -= 0.15\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# This adjusts the button positions to align them with the left-aligned question\n",
    "# text.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Missing Sound/Particle Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "# The errors you're encountering are due to the application not being able to\n",
    "# find the sound and particle effect files. Here's how to handle this:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 1. Handle missing sound files:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the `setup_sounds` method to use a `try-except` block:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# def setup_sounds(self):\n",
    "#     try:\n",
    "#         # Update the path to your sound files\n",
    "#         script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n",
    "#         self.correct_sound = self.loader.loadSfx(os.path.join(script_dir, \"sounds/correct.wav\"))\n",
    "#         self.wrong_sound = self.loader.loadSfx(os.path.join(script_dir, \"sounds/wrong.wav\"))\n",
    "#     except Exception as e:\n",
    "#         print(f\"Warning: Sound files not found. Continuing without sound effects. Error: {e}\")\n",
    "#         self.correct_sound = None\n",
    "#         self.wrong_sound = None\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# This attempts to load the sound files. If an exception occurs (e.g., the files\n",
    "# are not found), it prints a warning and sets the sound variables to `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 2. Make particle effects optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Similarly, modify the `create_particles` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# def create_particles(self):\n",
    "#     try:\n",
    "#         script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n",
    "#         self.p = ParticleEffect()\n",
    "#         self.p.loadConfig(os.path.join(script_dir, \"particles/sparkles.ptf\"))\n",
    "#         self.p.start(parent=self.render)\n",
    "#     except Exception as e:\n",
    "#         print(f\"Warning: Particle effects not found. Continuing without particles. Error: {e}\")\n",
    "#         self.p = None\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# This handles the case where the particle effect configuration file is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "# To ensure the application can find the necessary files, create the following\n",
    "# directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "# your_project_directory/\n",
    "#     quizApp_panda.py\n",
    "#     questions.json\n",
    "#     sounds/\n",
    "#         correct.wav\n",
    "#         wrong.wav\n",
    "#     particles/\n",
    "#         sparkles.ptf\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Example `questions.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```json\n",
    "# [\n",
    "#     {\n",
    "#         \"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n",
    "#         \"options\": {\n",
    "#             \"A\": \"London\",\n",
    "#             \"B\": \"Paris\",\n",
    "#             \"C\": \"Berlin\",\n",
    "#             \"D\": \"Madrid\"\n",
    "#         },\n",
    "#         \"answer\": \"B\"\n",
    "#     },\n",
    "#     {\n",
    "#         \"question\": \"What is 2 + 2?\",\n",
    "#         \"options\": {\n",
    "#             \"A\": \"3\",\n",
    "#             \"B\": \"4\",\n",
    "#             \"C\": \"5\",\n",
    "#             \"D\": \"6\"\n",
    "#         },\n",
    "#         \"answer\": \"B\"\n",
    "#     }\n",
    "# ]\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Key Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "# -   **Text Alignment:** The question text and buttons are now left-aligned.\n",
    "# -   **Error Handling:** The application now handles missing sound and particle\n",
    "#     files gracefully.\n",
    "# -   **Readability:** The code is better structured and commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By implementing these changes, your Panda3D quiz application should have a\n",
    "# cleaner layout and be more robust to missing files."
