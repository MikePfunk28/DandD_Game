    "\n",
    "1. **Movement System:**\n",
    "   - **Dice Roll or Card Draw:** Players can choose to roll a die or draw a card to determine their movement.\n",
    "   - **Region and Availability Zone (AZ) Selection:** Players land on different regions and AZs based on their movement.\n",
    "   - **Home Region:** Each player has a designated home region with specific advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Serverless Spells:**\n",
    "   - **Quick-Use Abilities:** Represent serverless services (e.g., AWS Lambda, CloudFront) as spells that provide quick advantages.\n",
    "   - **Spell Mechanics:** Spells can be cast during encounters to influence outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Turn-Based Setup and Threat Encounters:**\n",
    "   - **Setup Phase:** At the beginning of each turn, players choose security measures.\n",
    "   - **Threat Encounter:** Players face threats based on the region they've landed in.\n",
    "   - **Charges and Constraints:** Operating in non-home regions incurs charges, affecting resource management.\n",
